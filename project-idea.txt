I've already related this idea to Dr. Alfaro, but to live up to class obligations, I'll describe it here.  

I would like to create an analysis of dispersal kernels using isolation by distance.  The idea is to use create a Approximate Bayesian Computation method that simulates dispersal over a variety of kernel types and then to determine the kernel for empirical data that I have for Cactus Wrens and California Gnatcatchers.  There is a population genetics simulation program called IBD_Sim that I would like to center the code around.  I would create a randomizer to create input into IBD_Sim, simulate a variety of dispersal kernels, and then analyze those psuedo-datasets to determine the most likely scenario based upon some set of summary statistics.  

###update

I need to make a mid-stream switch.  The task I created for myself above is far too large given the great many obligations
of the 2nd quarter.  Plus, this project was meant to aim for gold of meeting my quantitative obligations when in fact
I have a stats class scheduled for next quarter for that purpsoe.  Instead, I'm switching to a more reasonable, more likely 
to be accomplished within the time frame project.  

Namely, I'm going to grab data from ebird for the 2 species on which I'm presently working, the Tricolored Blackbird and
the Burrowing Owl, and attempt to build habitat models for the species with MAXENT.  If possible, I would like to find 
additional layers beyond the typical climatic ones to fine-tune the models.  For the Tricolored Blackbird, that would include 
information about standing water, which is a requirement for breeding.  For the Burrowing Owl, having information 
about the presence of fossorial mammals would be beneficial. 

I'm going to attempt to catch up on lagging requirements for this project today, 2/24/2017.
